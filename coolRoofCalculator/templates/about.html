          <p>Cool Roof is a roofing technology which reflects the solar radiations and emits heat back into the sky instead of transferring it into the building below. This property of coolness of the roof is measured by two major properties of the roof surface.

       A reflective roof is typically light in color and absorbs less sunlight than a conventional dark colored roof. Less absorption of sunlight lowers the roof.s surface temperature, reducing the heat transfer through the roof. This property of the roof makes it a Cool Roof.

       When the roof surface is painted white or treated white, the surface temperature of the roof decreases. This further decreases the temperature difference between the outdoor and the indoor thereby reducing the heat gain into the rooms through conduction. This heat transfer can be measured using the formula:</p>
	   <p align="center">Q= UA(&#916;T) </p>

		<p>The solar reflectivity is measured according to ASTM E903. Traditional roofing materials have a Solar Reflective Index (SRI) of between 5% (brown shingles) and 20% (green shingles). White shingles with SRI around 35% were popular in the 1960s, but they did not gain enough popularity later, since they are more prone to getting dirty which would reduce their performance. The current trend is to make white shingles more reflective. The other property of a roof material, emissivity, defines the ability of the material to radiate out the absorbed heat. All common roofing materials except metals generally have an emissivity of 0.9. Emissivity of metal roofs is around 0.5, due to which rooms with metal roof have less possibility of being cooler and comfortable. Materials with less emissivity are appropriate in cold climates.</p>
