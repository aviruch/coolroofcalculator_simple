   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=BLOCK1:ZONE1_GROUNDFLOOR_0_0_0
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** For object = Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed, name = "ZONE PTHP COOLING COIL"
   **   ~~~   ** Calculated outlet air relative humidity greater than 1. The combination of
   **   ~~~   ** rated air volume flow rate, total cooling capacity and sensible heat ratio yields coil exiting
   **   ~~~   ** air conditions above the saturation curve. Possible fixes are to reduce the rated total cooling
   **   ~~~   ** capacity, increase the rated air volume flow rate, or reduce the rated sensible heat ratio for this coil.
   **   ~~~   ** If autosizing, it is recommended that all three of these values be autosized.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Inputs used for calculating cooling coil bypass factor.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Inlet Air Temperature     = 26.67 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...Outlet Air Temperature    = 14.02 C
   **   ~~~   ** ...Inlet Air Humidity Ratio  = 1.125000E-002 kgWater/kgDryAir
   **   ~~~   ** ...Outlet Air Humidity Ratio = 9.985167E-003 kgWater/kgDryAir
   **   ~~~   ** ...Total Cooling Capacity used in calculation = 6097.52 W
