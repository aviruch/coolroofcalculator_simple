   ** Warning ** Processing Monthly Tabular Reports: Variable names not valid for this simulation
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual variables.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed="ZONE PTHP COOLING COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling capacity is out of range at 6.944E-005 m3/s/W.
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=RUNPERIODCOOLROOF, at Simulation time=01/03 11:40 - 11:50
   **   ~~~   ** Expected range for VolumeFlowPerRatedTotalCapacity=[2.684E-005--6.713E-005]
   **   ~~~   ** Possible causes include inconsistent air flow rates in system components,
   **   ~~~   ** or variable air volume [VAV] system using incorrect coil type.
